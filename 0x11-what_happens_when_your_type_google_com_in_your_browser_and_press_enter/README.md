What happens when you type Google and press enter

When you type "google.com" into your web browser's address bar and press Enter, several things typically happen:

1. DNS Resolution: Your web browser sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with "google.com," which is 172.217.5.78 as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.

2. Establishing a TCP Connection: Your browser then initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the IP address obtained in the previous step. This connection is used to establish a reliable communication channel with Google's web servers.

3. Sending an HTTP Request: Once the TCP connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the Google web server located at the IP address. The request typically specifies the resource you're looking for, such as the default homepage.

4. Receiving a Response: Google's web server processes your request and sends back an HTTP response. In the case of typing "google.com," this response typically includes the Google homepage. The response may also contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources needed to render the webpage properly in your browser.

5. Rendering the Webpage: Your web browser receives the response from the server and begins rendering the webpage. It interprets the HTML code, styles it with CSS, and executes any JavaScript code present on the page to make it interactive.

6. Displaying the Page: Finally, your browser displays the Google homepage on your screen, allowing you to interact with the search engine and perform searches.

This entire process, from typing "google.com" to seeing the Google homepage, usually happens very quickly and is the basic sequence of events that occurs when you visit a website by entering its domain name in your web browser. Keep in mind that the details may vary slightly based on your browser's specific implementation and any recent changes or updates made by Google or your DNS provider.
